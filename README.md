Press **Ctrl + 1**, **Ctrl + 2** or **Ctrl + 3** to export video in **120 bpm**, **150 bpm** or **180 bpm** respectively.

## Limitations

The rendering process records the area over the program window, so do not clutter it. No other window or mouse movements should be made over the program video while the export animation plays.
Do not move the window after it is opened, as it will be out of bounds in the exported video.
The program horizontal resolution is fixed to 1080 pixels, and should be used only on monitors with 1080p minimal resolution.
Just open, select elements and export.

## Known bugs

UI become unresponisive after the export animation.
